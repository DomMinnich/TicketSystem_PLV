# TicketSystem_PLV

**Developed, designed, and deployed by Dominic Minnich

Currently in production and in use at Bishop Dwneger High School and Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton School**

This self-hosted ticket management system enables users to create, view, and close tickets, with email notifications sent upon ticket creation and commenting. 
Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, the system includes features like full forum commenting, multi-connectivity email notifications, and a department-specific task management system.

Admins can change account roles, delete accounts, and change account passwords. They are also able to delete and close tickets. They receive emails for tickets within their associated departments.
Tickets and comments can contain files.

Email notifications are sent upon ticket creation and comments.

Gemini AI is built into the system as a chatbot that can be asked questions through an IT help desk lens.
